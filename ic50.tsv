The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

A 96-well plate was pretreated with blocker casein and 1 mM biotin for 30 minutes, and then biotin-linked HIF-1α556-574 (biotinyl-DLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQL) was immobilized on the 96-well plate. The 96-well plate was then filled with an appropriate amount of HIF-PHD2-containing buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM 2-oxoglutarate, 10 mM FeSO4, 2 mM ascorbic acid, 4% EDTA-free protease inhibitor) and was incubated for 1 to 60 minutes at RT. The reaction mixture also contained different concentrations of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors to be tested. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the 96-well plate three times with washing buffer. In 100 μl binding buffer (50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl), hydroxylated HIF-1α556-574 was reacted with EuVBC protein in the binding buffer at RT for 60 minutes. The reaction solution was aspirated, and the unbound EuVBC protein was washed away by washing 3 times with an elution buffer. Subsequently, 10 μl of rabbit anti-EuVBC polyclonal antibody was added. After further 30 minutes, 10 μl of anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase was added to the binding buffer. To determine the amount of bound EuVBC protein, it was incubated with TMB for 15 minutes. The color reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 M sulfuric acid. The amount of bound EuVBC protein was determined by measuring optical density at 450 nm, which was proportional to the amount of hydroxylated proline in the peptide substrate."

Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production."

Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 μL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate).

Compounds were pre-incubated for 30 min before starting the reaction (all test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and were tested with final compound concentrations at 100 μM in 1% DMSO (w/v)). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μI) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in succinic acid production.

The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM. All compounds were diluted at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and tested from 10 μM to 3 nM at half-log serial dilutions, with a final concentration of 2% DMSO (w/v) in the assay."

Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 μL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate).

(Dublin Calif.), respectively. Peptides for use in the assay were fragments of HIFalpha as described above or as disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein. For example, a HIF peptide for use in the HIF-PH assay was [methoxycoumarin]-DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL-amide. HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (also known as EGLN1 or PHD2), was expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity was determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304).

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1alpha peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1alpha (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction.

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1alpha peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1alpha (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1α (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 uL of reaction mixture to 50 uL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate)."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMVEGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate)."

HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (EGLN1), can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304). Assay reactions contain 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 uM alpha -ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 uCi/mL ketoglutaric acid alpha -[1-14C]-sodium sodium salt."

(Dublin Calif.), respectively. Peptides for use in the assay may be fragments of HIFα as described above or as disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein. HIF-pH, e.g., PHD1 (EGLN2) or PHD2 (EGLN1), can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304). Assay reactions contain 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μM α-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 mCi/mL ketoglutaric acid α-[1-14C]-sodium salt, 40 μM FeSO4, 1 mM ascorbate, 1541.8 units/mL Catalase, with or without 50 μM peptide substrate and various concentrations of compound of the invention.

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 μL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate). Hydroxylated peptide product is identified from substrate by the gain of 16 Da. Data defined as percent conversion of substrate to product is analyzed in GraphPad Prism 4 to calculate IC50 values."

(Dublin Calif.), respectively. Peptides for use in the assay may be fragments of HIFalpha as described above or as disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein. For example, a HIF peptide for use in the HIF-PH assay is [methoxycoumarin]-DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL-amide. HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (EGLN1), can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304).

Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μI) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.)."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMVEGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4).

Compounds were pre-incubated for 30 min before starting the reaction (all test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and were tested with final compound concentrations at 100 μM in 1% DMSO (w/v)). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μI) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.)."

The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

In 100 μl binding buffer (50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl), hydroxylated HIF-1α556-574 was reacted with EuVBC protein in the binding buffer at RT for 60 minutes. The reaction solution was aspirated, and the unbound EuVBC protein was washed away by washing 3 times with an elution buffer. Subsequently, 10 μl of rabbit anti-EuVBC polyclonal antibody was added. After further 30 minutes, 10 μl of anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase was added to the binding buffer. To determine the amount of bound EuVBC protein, it was incubated with TMB for 15 minutes. The color reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 M sulfuric acid. The amount of bound EuVBC protein was determined by measuring optical density at 450 nm, which was proportional to the amount of hydroxylated proline in the peptide substrate."

HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (EGLN1), can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304). Assay reactions contain 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 uM α-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 uCi/mL ketoglutaric acid α-[1-14C]-sodium salt, 40 uM FeSO4, 1 mM ascorbate, 1541.8 units/mL Catalase, with or without 50 uM peptide substrate and various concentrations of compound of the disclosure.

Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM. All compounds were diluted at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and tested from 10 μM to 3 nM at half-log serial dilutions, with a final concentration of 2% DMSO (w/v) in the assay."

Compounds were pre-incubated for 30 min before starting the reaction (all test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and were tested with final compound concentrations at 100 μM in 1% DMSO (w/v)). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production."

Compounds were pre-incubated for 30 min before starting the reaction (all test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and were tested with final compound concentrations at 100 μM in 1% DMSO (w/v)). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μI) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.)."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMVEGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate)."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMVEGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate)."

After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 LIL of reaction mixture to 50 LL of a mass spectrometry matrix Solution (C-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NHPO). Two micro liters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 HZ repetition rate). Hydroxylated peptide product is identified from substrate by the gain of 16 Da. Data defined as percent conversion of Substrate to product is analyzed in GraphPad Prism 4 to calculate ICso values."

The PHD enzymatic assay was then performed by transferring the purified PHD2181-417 polypeptide (3 μg) mixture with compound to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing the following: synthetic HIF-1α peptide comprising residues [KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLS] (10 μM, California Peptide Research Inc., Napa, Calif.), and [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid (50 mCi/mmol, Moravek Chemicals, Brea, Calif.) in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ascorbate) for 10 minutes in the presence of compound. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature.

The PHD enzymatic assay was then performed by transferring the purified PHD2181-417 polypeptide (3 μg) mixture with compound to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing the following: synthetic HIF-1α peptide comprising residues [KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLS] (10 μM, California Peptide Research Inc., Napa, Calif.), and [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid (50 mCi/mmol, Moravek Chemicals, Brea, Calif.) in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ascorbate) for 10 minutes in the presence of compound. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM. All compounds were diluted at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and tested from 10 μM to 3 nM at half-log serial dilutions, with a final concentration of 2% DMSO (w/v) in the assay."

The PHD enzymatic assay was then performed by transferring the purified PHD2181-417 polypeptide (3 μg) mixture with compound to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing the following: synthetic HIF-1α peptide comprising residues [KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLS] (10 μM, California Peptide Research Inc., Napa, Calif.), and [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid (50 mCi/mmol, Moravek Chemicals, Brea, Calif.) in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ascorbate) for 10 minutes in the presence of compound. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM. All compounds were diluted at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and tested from 10 μM to 3 nM at half-log serial dilutions, with a final concentration of 2% DMSO (w/v) in the assay."

Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 μL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate). Hydroxylated peptide product is identified from substrate by the gain of 16 Da. Data defined as percent conversion of substrate to product is analyzed in GraphPad Prism 4 to calculate IC50 values."

Compounds were pre-incubated for 30 min before starting the reaction (all test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and were tested with final compound concentrations at 100 μM in 1% DMSO (w/v)). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μI) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.).

The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 μL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate). Hydroxylated peptide product is identified from substrate by the gain of 16 Da. Data defined as percent conversion of substrate to product is analyzed in GraphPad Prism 4 to calculate IC50 values."

The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1C. peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPAD DDFQL) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1C. (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl Sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 LIL of reaction mixture to 50 LL of a mass spectrometry matrix Solution (C-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NHPO). Two micro liters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 HZ repetition rate).

The PHD enzymatic assay was then performed by transferring the purified PHD2181-417 polypeptide (3 μg) mixture with compound to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing the following: synthetic HIF-1α peptide comprising residues [KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLS] (10 μM, California Peptide Research Inc., Napa, Calif.), and [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid (50 mCi/mmol, Moravek Chemicals, Brea, Calif.) in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ascorbate) for 10 minutes in the presence of compound. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1C. peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPAD DDFQL) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1C. (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl Sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 LIL of reaction mixture to 50 LL of a mass spectrometry matrix Solution (C-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NHPO). Two micro liters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 HZ repetition rate).

The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

The PHD enzymatic assay was then performed by transferring the purified PHD2181-417 polypeptide (3 μg) mixture with compound to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing the following: synthetic HIF-1α peptide comprising residues [KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLS] (10 μM, California Peptide Research Inc., Napa, Calif.), and [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid (50 mCi/mmol, Moravek Chemicals, Brea, Calif.) in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ascorbate) for 10 minutes in the presence of compound. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

The PHD enzymatic assay was then performed by transferring the purified PHD2181-417 polypeptide (3 μg) mixture with compound to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing the following: synthetic HIF-1α peptide comprising residues [KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLS] (10 μM, California Peptide Research Inc., Napa, Calif.), and [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid (50 mCi/mmol, Moravek Chemicals, Brea, Calif.) in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ascorbate) for 10 minutes in the presence of compound. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM. All compounds were diluted at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and tested from 10 μM to 3 nM at half-log serial dilutions, with a final concentration of 2% DMSO (w/v) in the assay."

Compounds were pre-incubated for 30 min before starting the reaction (all test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and were tested with final compound concentrations at 100 μM in 1% DMSO (w/v)). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μI) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.)."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMVEGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate), Hydroxylated peptide product is identified from substrate by the gain of 16 Da. Data defined as percent conversion of substrate to product is analyzed in GraphPad Prism 4 to calculate IC50 values."

Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV-EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1α (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 uL of reaction mixture to 50 uL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4).

The PHD enzymatic assay was then performed by transferring the purified PHD2181-417 polypeptide (3 μg) mixture with compound to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing the following: synthetic HIF-1α peptide comprising residues [KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLS] (10 μM, California Peptide Research Inc., Napa, Calif.), and [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid (50 mCi/mmol, Moravek Chemicals, Brea, Calif.) in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ascorbate) for 10 minutes in the presence of compound. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM.

Compounds were pre-incubated for 30 min before starting the reaction (all test compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and were tested with final compound concentrations at 100 μM in 1% DMSO (w/v)). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 70 mM H3PO4 and 50 μl of 500 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.2. Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μI) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in succinic acid production.

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMVEGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4).

(Dublin Calif.), respectively. Peptides for use in the assay may be fragments of HIFα as described above or as disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein. For example, a HIF peptide for use in the HIF-PH assay is [methoxycoumarin]-DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL-amide. HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (EGLN1), can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304). Assay reactions contain 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 uM α-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 uCi/mL ketoglutaric acid α-[1-14C]-sodium salt, 40 uM FeSO4, 1 mM ascorbate, 1541.8 units/mL Catalase, with or without 50 uM peptide substrate and various concentrations of compound of the disclosure.

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1C. peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPAD DDFQL) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1C. (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction.

The reaction solution was aspirated, and the unbound Eu-VBC protein was washed away by washing 3 times with an elution buffer. Subsequently, 10 μl of rabbit anti-Eu-VBC polyclonal antibody was added. After further 30 minutes, 10 μl of anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase was added to the binding buffer. To determine the amount of bound Eu-VBC protein, it was incubated with TMB for 15 minutes. The color reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 M sulfuric acid. The amount of bound Eu-VBC protein was determined by measuring optical density at 450 nm, which was proportional to the amount of hydroxylated proline in the peptide substrate."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMV EGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1C. peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPAD DDFQL) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 uM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 uM), HIF-1C. (8.6 uM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl Sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 LIL of reaction mixture to 50 LL of a mass spectrometry matrix Solution (C-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NHPO).

Effect of Compounds on Activities of HIF Prolyl Hydroxylase-2 Activities of HIF prolyl hydroxylase was determined according to the method as described in Anal Biochem, 2004, 330: 74-80, which was slightly modified. A 96-well plate was pretreated with blocker casein and 1 mM biotin for 30 minutes, and then biotin-linked HIF-1α556-574 (biotinyl-DLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQL) was immobilized on the 96-well plate.

In 100 μl binding buffer (50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl), hydroxylated HIF-1α556-574 was reacted with Eu-VBC protein in the binding buffer at RT for 60 minutes. The reaction solution was aspirated, and the unbound Eu-VBC protein was washed away by washing 3 times with an elution buffer. Subsequently, 10 μl of rabbit anti-Eu-VBC polyclonal antibody was added. After further 30 minutes, 10 μl of anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase was added to the binding buffer. To determine the amount of bound Eu-VBC protein, it was incubated with TMB for 15 minutes. The color reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 M sulfuric acid. The amount of bound Eu-VBC protein was determined by measuring optical density at 450 nm, which was proportional to the amount of hydroxylated proline in the peptide substrate."

(Dublin Calif.), respectively. Peptides for use in the assay were fragments of HIFα as described above or as disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein. For example, a HIF peptide for use in the HIF-PH assay was [methoxycoumarin]-DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL-amide. HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (also known as EGLN1 or PHD2), was expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity was determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304). Assay reactions contained 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μM α-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 μCi/mL α-ketoglutaric acid α-[1-14C]-sodium salt, 40 μM FeSO4, 1 mM ascorbate, 1541.8 units/mL Catalase, with or without 50 μM peptide substrate and various concentrations of compound of the invention. Reactions were initiated by addition of HIF-PH enzyme. The peptide-dependent percent turnover was calculated by subtracting percent turnover in the absence of peptide from percent turnover in the presence of substrate peptide. Percent inhibition and IC50 were calculated using peptide-dependent percent turnover at given inhibitor concentrations. Calculation of IC50 values for each inhibitor was conducted using GraFit software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Surrey UK)."

Recombinant human EGLN-1-179/426 is prepared as described above and in the Supplemental Data. Full-length recombinant human EGLN-3 is prepared in a similar way, however it is necessary to use the His-MBP-TVMVEGLN-3 fusion for the assay due to the instability of the cleaved protein. For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%). The enzyme, quantity predetermined to hydroxylate 20% of substrate in 20 minutes, is added to start the reaction. Where inhibitors are used, compounds are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-fold final assay concentration. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by transferring 10 μL of reaction mixture to 50 μL of a mass spectrometry matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, 5 mM NH4PO4). Two microliters of the mixture is spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS target plate for analysis with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 3 ns pulse width, 200 Hz repetition rate), Hydroxylated peptide product is identified from substrate by the gain of 16 Da.

Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Detection of [14C]-succinic acid was achieved by separating from [5-14C]-2-oxoglutaric acid by incubating the reaction mixture with 100 μl of 0.16 M DNP prepared in 30% perchloric acid. Next, 50 μl of unlabeled 20 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid/20 mM succinic acid, serving as carrier for the radioactivity, was added to the mixture, and was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated with 50 μl of 1 M 2-oxoglutaric acid for 30 additional minutes at room temperature to precipitate the excess DNP. The reaction was then centrifuged at 2800×g for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate [14C]-succinic acid in the supernatant from the precipitated [14C]-dinitrophenylhydrazone. Fractions of the supernatant (400 μl) were counted using a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Inhibition of PHD2181-417 activity was measured as a decrease in [14C]-succinic acid production. The IC50 values were estimated by fitting the data to a three-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism, version 4.02 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). IC50 values up to 10 μM were quantified otherwise were noted as >10 μM. All compounds were diluted at 10 mM in 100% DMSO (w/v) and tested from 10 μM to 3 nM at half-log serial dilutions, with a final concentration of 2% DMSO (w/v) in the assay."

For both enzymes, the HIF-1α peptide corresponding to residues 556-574 (DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL) (SEQ ID NO. 1) is used as substrate. The reaction is conducted in a total volume of 50 uL containing TrisCl (5 mM, pH 7.5), ascorbate (120 μM), 2-oxoglutarate (3.2 μM), HIF-1α (8.6 μM), and bovine serum albumin (0.01%).

The reaction solution was aspirated, and the unbound Eu-VBC protein was washed away by washing 3 times with an elution buffer. Subsequently, 10 μl of rabbit anti-Eu-VBC polyclonal antibody was added. After further 30 minutes, 10 μl of anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase was added to the binding buffer. To determine the amount of bound Eu-VBC protein, it was incubated with TMB for 15 minutes. The color reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 M sulfuric acid. The amount of bound Eu-VBC protein was determined by measuring optical density at 450 nm, which was proportional to the amount of hydroxylated proline in the peptide substrate."

The reaction solution was aspirated, and the unbound Eu-VBC protein was washed away by washing 3 times with an elution buffer. Subsequently, 10 μl of rabbit anti-Eu-VBC polyclonal antibody was added. After further 30 minutes, 10 μl of anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase was added to the binding buffer. To determine the amount of bound Eu-VBC protein, it was incubated with TMB for 15 minutes. The color reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 M sulfuric acid.
